********************************************************
A library for building a RESTful interface to graph data
********************************************************
The Dozer library provides classes for converting dictionary-like data (notably, JSON objects) into graph triples (node-edge-node), and for writing those triples to persistent storage. The classes also provide validation of the data throughout conversion. Currently the library is focused on translating dictionaries into RDF triples, and witing those triples to a SPARQL endpoint.
